## Agile:
Agile was first introduced to us by ‘**Manifesto for Agile Software Development**’ which was structured around software development methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. 
The year 2001 can be attributed to the inception of the term agile when a team of software developers met in order to discuss over various development methodologies. 
The agile methodologies spans across different methods which are used to implement agile:
* Dynamic Systems Development Method.
* Crystal method.
* Extreme programming edition.
* Adaptive software development.
* Scrum.
* Feature Driven Development.
* Lean Development.
* EVO
* Agile UP.
* Crystal .
* Dynamic Systems Development Method.

**Features of Agile development Methodology:**
* Quality is guaranteed as the product goes through a regular and thorough inspection process after every sprint it finishes.
* Transparency is ensured between the product development team and the stakeholders so they get a glimpse of how the product development takes place. Such an endeavour ensures filling gap in communicating requirements between stakeholders and product owners. 
* Early detection of defects or bugs saves a lot of time and effort in saving last minute corrections. Incremental releases in agile offers the opportunity to identify problems much earlier in the SDLC thus ensuring least bug prior release.
* Continuous integration and iterative releases increases visibility and active participation of members for a particular project. An important aspect of agile methodology’s continuous integration approach is its adaptability to changes and eventually evolving throughout the process of product development and testing. 
* Cost is predictable as the work is divided in a very calculative manner and hence the work is performed within fixed sprints or time frame. Therefore budget for an agile project is quite planned and in sorted manner. 
## DevOps:
DevOps is a methodology which states that development team and the operations team must work in a well-coordinated manner. 
The idea of DevOps emerged as a result of a discussion concerning agile infrastructure. The concept gradually started taking shape in 2008-2009,during an event held in Belgium.According to reports, in Agile Toronto conference Andrew Shafer and Patrick Debois coined the term‘DevOps’ in their talk about agile infrastructure. 
The ideology of DevOps is more of a cultural shift rather than a radical change throughout SDLC. Well we cannot specify a year or a date when DevOps was conceptualised, however it arose out of the need to have a robust system wherein we can be more participative and vocal about what’s going on, from the perspective of the sum total of people involved in the application being developed. 
“Fewer failures, faster delivery”is what DevOps aims to seek. 

**Features of DevOps:**
* Continuous integration and delivery.
* Lesser complexity as teams have a chance to divide their work into easily manageable task.
* Quicker solution to a given problem.
* Communication is improved.
## Lean:
Lean software development is derived from ‘Lean manufacturing’. Lean manufacturing is a method wherein the idea is to minimise waste within a manufacturing system maintaining the efficiency in productivity. 

**Principles on which Lean software development is based:**
* Waste is anything in the context of software development life cycle, which doesn’t prove to be of much value in the process of software development. 
* Building a system which can totally avoid a defect occurrence,completely by applying a defect tracking system which tracks partially completed work 
* The idea followed in lean development is to create in smaller portions, getting feedback from the customers/end user
* Lean methodology follows an reversible decision making strategy, by which we mean to say that going ahead with a plan is fine but there must be a scope to change decisions taken initially just to make things work in favour of project improvement
* Faster delivery of the product under development needs to be considered so as to keep pace with the expectations of the customers.
* Respect for people is another essential factor to maintain a coordination between project leaders and the team members
* Lean methodology inculcates a value into the system thereby ensuring an optimised operation of the system
## Summary:
1. Agile methodology emphasises on continuous integration of changes (feature/code/design) into any phase of the product development along with working in time frames.
2. DevOps aims to align [Software development team](https://www.thinksys.com/services/software-development/) with the operations team (responsible for handling customer queries and feedback once the product is released) so that deviations could be handled efficiently 
3. Lean development is a technique derived from traditional manufacturing companies followed by ‘Toyota Production System’, which used to apply waste management practices by releasing smaller increments of the work to be done at large. Wastes in this context includes Partial work, extra processes, switching between tasks, extra features etc. that add no value to the overall system being developed.
